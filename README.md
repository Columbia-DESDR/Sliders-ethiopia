# desdr-ethiopia-demo
 
 This is a public demonstration of the DESDR system for Ethiopia. The demo includes real data sources for `Chirps` and `administrative regions`. The queries are indicative of real queries in terms of complexity, but they may not match the analyses that will be used in a full deployment.
